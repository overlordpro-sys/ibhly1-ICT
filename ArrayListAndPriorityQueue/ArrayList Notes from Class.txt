    private Object[] length 10, 
                     size --> # of objects currently in list (zero)

ArrayList<???> list = new ArrayList<???>(5); 
          private Object[] length 5, 
                     size --> # of objects currently in list (zero)

                     
     
when adding to an ArrayList, size increases, possibly shifting values
to the right (depending on where you add the obj)

once you reach capacity: the next time add is called, a new array is 
created with DOUBLE the capacity, the old values are copied over, and the 
private is now pointing to the new array

when removing, size decreases, don't mess w/ capacity, shifting is 
done, depending on which index is used in the removed
